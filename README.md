#### Requirements
My setup is made on Ubuntu 20.04, though I imagine it will work with most distros

- i3 with i3-gaps
- kitty terminal emulator
- fish shell
	- fisher plugin manager
- kakoune
- rofi
	- rofi-calc
- compton
- ffmpeg
- i3bar
- i3status
- i3lock
- scrot
- xclip
- ffmpeg (required for pixelated lock screen)

For most distros, I recommend removing nm-applet.desktop from /etc/xdg/autostart/ and using nmtui to set network options, for a cleaner bar
